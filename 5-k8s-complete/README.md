# K8s: End to End 

# PODs: 
```
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage
in Kubernetes.
A pod is a group of containers that run on a Kubernetes cluster, which is a collection of pods. A container is a package of software that holds your application or service and everything it needs to run.
```

# Types of PODs

# Single Container PODs:

```
One container per POD, When you deploy your applications and youâ€™ve got a web container and an app container,  each of them could be in their own pods.
```

# Examples:
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:alpine
```
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:alpine
pod/nginx created
$ kubectl run tomcat --image=tomcat:8.0
pod/tomcat created
$ kubectl get pods
