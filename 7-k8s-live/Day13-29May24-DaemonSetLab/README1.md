The differences between HPA and VPA in Kubernetes:

HPA scales by adding or removing pods, thus scaling capacity horizontally.
VPA scales by increasing or decreasing CPU and memory resources within the existing pod containers, thus scaling capacity vertically.

HPA adjusts the number of replicas of an application.
VPA adjusts the resource requests and limits of a container.

HPA works on the pod and cluster levels.
VPA works on the container level.
