# K8s: End to End 

# PODs: 
```
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage
in Kubernetes.
A pod is a group of containers that run on a Kubernetes cluster, which is a collection of pods. A container is a package of software that holds your application or service and everything it needs to run.
```

# Types of PODs

# Single Container PODs:

```
One container per POD, When you deploy your applications and youâ€™ve got a web container and an app container,  each of them could be in their own pods.
```

# Examples:
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:alpine
```
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:alpine
pod/nginx created
$ kubectl run tomcat --image=tomcat:8.0
pod/tomcat created
$ kubectl get pods

# ReplicaSet:

% A pod could die for all kinds of reasons such as a node that it was running on had failed, it ran out of resources, 
% it was stopped for some reason, etc. If the pod dies, it stays dead until someone fixes it which is not ideal, but with containers we should expect them to be short lived anyway, 

$ cat replicaset.yaml
