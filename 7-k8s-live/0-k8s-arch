# Master Worker architecture

Master Node:
    etcd
        key-value db used as backlog store for all cluster configuration data
    kube-controller-manager
        run k8s controllers
    kube-scheduler
        decides which node should be used for each Pod
    kube-apiserver
        allows interacting with the control plane

Worker Node:
    kube proxy
        maintain n/w rules on nodes
    kubelet
        manage containers on node
    container-runtime
        run containers on node
